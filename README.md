Notepad+=1 now allows notepad.exe lovers to use notepad but with some enhancements.
* Automatically save unsaved text to disk.
* Detect large files that open slowly and provide a quick preview while waiting to load.
* Detect Unix line endings and provide an option to open in wordpad.

With Notepad+=1 you can continue to use the classic lightweight text editor without so many of the warts.
